#PyPortal Display for Home Assistant

This is the code.py file used on an [Adafruit PyPortal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116), which display sensor data from Home Assistant, has button for triggering things in Home Assistant, and can take commands over MQTT from Home Assistant to control an [Adafruit Mini Skinny NeoPixel strip of 30 LEDs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2954). Heavily inspired by [Adafruit's PyPortal MQTT Sensor Node/Control Pad for Home Assistant](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-mqtt-sensor-node-control-pad-home-assistant?view=all).

I'll add the link to my blog post when it's published.
