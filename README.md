# PyPortal Display for Home Assistant

This is the code.py file used on an [Adafruit PyPortal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116), which displays sensor data from Home Assistant, has buttons for triggering things in Home Assistant, and can take commands over MQTT from Home Assistant to control an [Adafruit Mini Skinny NeoPixel strip of 30 LEDs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2954) as a silent notification system. Heavily inspired by [Adafruit's PyPortal MQTT Sensor Node/Control Pad for Home Assistant](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-mqtt-sensor-node-control-pad-home-assistant?view=all).
